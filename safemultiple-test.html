Safe Multiple is a Value Swing Trading system. 
Its core strategy is to make bets that have least downside risk. The system is 
built on the principle of “Factor of Safety”. This Principle is laid out in the textbook 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2Wzj0Ne"target=_blank>Security Analysis By Graham and Dodd</a>.</span>   
<br>
 <span class="header"><b>What is Safe Multiple's Goal?

To develop a Stock Trading System that consistently beats the major indexes <i>(S&P-500, NASDAQ-100 and Dow Jones Industrial average)</i>

   <div>
I am Daya, developer of Safe Multiple.On 1/1/2020 I started a model portfolio with my own 
capital of $12,837. Goal is to test and fine tune my trading system. Hope to use this website to share my learnings with others.

        </div>
	  <br>
	  <span class="header"><b>How is the model portfolio doing?
   </b></span>
	 <div>As of 9/30/2021, the model portfolio had grown to $22,576.
	   Growth of  $9,739 , which equates to a  <b>return of 75.86% in 21 months.</b>
	   Portfolio was started on 1/1/2020 with a capital of $12,837. No additional capital has been added since then.

   </b></span>
	   <div>As of 9/30/2021, the model portfolio had total <b>cash of $14,083</b>. Thus I am currently
	   playing with house's money, because the total cash of the portfolio is greater than the initial investment
	   of $12,837.

	     <span class="header"><b>How do I rate myself as an Investor?

		  <div>To begin with, I can certainly say that I am not an expert. I am an amateur who still
        has a day job. But I am seriously working towards becoming a professional investor someday. I love tennis,
        thus in tennis terminology I can say that I am a decent club level player with 5.0 rating. Someone who has learned good shot 
		anticipation and can consistently hit different strokes with depth and control. But I have a long way to go before I debut
        at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

		  <div>Security Analysis text book is divided into 7 sections . 
 In total it contains 52 chapters and 851 pages. It can be a daunting task to understand all the principles laid down in the book. 
 Thus I thought of creating a study aid that would have Quiz questions which in turn would help any investor
 assess how much he/she has understood from the book. After studying  all the 52 chapters I have come up with 232 quiz 
 questions that cover all the major topics. <a href="Security-Analysis-Study-Guide.pdf"target=_blan>click here</a>to access the study guide.

<b>STEP-1</b>.	Develop a Watch list of stocks with good fundamentals.One should also understand the underlying business of the stock and how 
    it makes money.
</div>
<div class="shadow p-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#F7F3A3">
<b>STEP-2</b>.	Value each stock of the watch list, the valuation would determine the price at which the stock would be undervalued, 
in essence will have ample factor of safety and least downside risk. This is the price at which the stock would be bought.
</div>
<div class="shadow p-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#F7F3A3">
<b>STEP-3</b>.	Figure out the exit points, that is the price at which the stocks are fully valued. This is the price at which the stock 
is sold.
 
</div>
<div class="shadow p-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#F7F3A3">
<b>STEP-4</b>.	Wait patiently till the stocks become undervalued. Only then buy it, and don’t be greedy if the stock appreciates in short time, sell it at the price that was determined before.
On certain conditions the stock is sold prematurely. (a)&nbsp;If a defect is discovered in the valuation 
	(b) The fundamentals are drastically changed and the valuation is no more valid.

  <span class="header"><b>Learnings from my experience
   </b></span><br>
 1. What to do if the stock you bought goes down by 50%?
 <br><br>
 2. You dont need to be fully invested all the times.
 <br><br>
 3. Revenues and Earnings reported might be different than the true Economic picture
 <br><br>
 4. Buffett once advised a college grad to take up as many accounting classes as possible, because 
 accounting knowledge key is for one to analyze an annual report effectively. I can certainly attest
 on his piece of advice. I have analyzed over 800 annual reports and knowledge of accounting has been
 key for me.
 <br><br>
 5. Two basic things that help me be disciplined. My watchlist and Intrinsic value of my portfolio.
 <br><br>
 6. How to avoid market noise?
 <br><br>
 7. How to avoid catching falling knives. Learnt it hard from my investment in Hertz.
 <br><br>
 8. How to benefit from news outlets like CNBC? I do watch CNBC regularly. One needs to take the information 
 with grain of salt  because some contributors can be just selling their ideas.and find its hosts
 and contributors very knowledgeable. But some analysis is really valuable. My investment in Extended Stay
 is one of them that I would like to contribute to CNBC.
