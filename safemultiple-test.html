Welcome to Safe Multiple. I am Daya a Data Engineer in  Insurance domain. I have developed Safe Multiple, a Value Swing Trading system. 
Its core strategy is to make bets that have least downside risk. The system is 
built on the principle of “Factor of Safety”. This Principle was first laid out in the textbook 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2Wzj0Ne"target=_blank>Security Analysis By Graham and Dodd</a> To test my Trading system, on 1/1/2020 I started 
a model portfolio with my own capital of $12,837. I am managing this portfolio using Safe Multiple.

   It involves the following steps:
   <br>
1.	Develop a Watch list of stocks with good fundamentals.One should also understand the underlying business of the stock and how 
    it makes money.
<br>
2.	Value these stocks and figure out the price at which the stock would be undervalued, in essence will have ample factor of safety and least downside risk.
<br>
3.	Figure out the exit points, that is the price at which the stocks are fully valued. This is the price at which the stock is sold.
<br>
4.	Wait patiently till the stocks become undervalued. Only then buy it, and don’t be greedy if the stock appreciates in short time, sell it at the price that was determined before.
<br>
5.	When to sell the stock prematurely? The stock is sold prematurely if a defect is discovered in the valuation or the fundamentals are changed drastically and the valuation is no more valid.

	 <h3>What to do if your stock is down more than 50%?</h3>
	 
	 <div class="perf">Value Swing trading is only suitable to people with lots of patience, cool temperament and ability to 
	 ignore market emotions. If the fundamentals of your stock are still strong, then one needs to hold the stock even if its deep
	 in red. I bought Kohls stock at $51 in early 2020 with an exit price of $70. It was before the pandemic had hit us. 
	 By Oct-2020 the stock was down over 60%. By April-2021 the stock bounced back to $61 and I went from 60% loss to
	 10% gain in 6 months. That was a swing of almost 400%. I still believed in my exit price and continued to hold.
	 As of 9/30/2021, the stock was again down to $48 because of global logistics issue. The lesson here is that there 
	 is no guarantee, when the stock would reach its exit price, one needs to hold it if the fundamentals are strong.
