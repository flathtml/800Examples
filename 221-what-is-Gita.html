     <b>REFERENCE : Contents of this page refer to https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/ . This website is part of JK Yog Foundation which in turn is run 
	 under the leadership of Swami Mukundananda.</b>	 
	 <p>
            Swamiji was born on the 19th of December, 1960 and spent his early years in different parts of India with his parents. He completed his B.Tech at IIT, Delhi and subsequently his post-graduate management degree at IIM, Kolkata. Soon, he was walking the corridors of one of the biggest corporate houses in India and a flying career was set to take off.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Swamiji had other ideas. Slowly but steadily, his interest in the world of spirituality and search for a deeper meaning in life had grown from very early age. Swamiji recounts his experience as a youngster when he used to spend long hours in meditation and contemplation. His interest widened as he breezed past high school and college. He would pour into books of saints and scriptures to understand their teachings and increasing spend more time thinking about God than anything else. By the time he graduated, his hunger for spiritual awakening grew ever stronger and he started to follow the path of Shree Krishna Bhakti. Within a few months of his first job, he was already typing his resignation letter!
        </p>
        <p>
            Swamiji’s life took a turn for good with his renunciation of material progress and life. Taking up the order of Sanyas, he soon set out on a path of spiritual journey that took him to the holy land of Braj and many other places across India. His experiences with enlightened and scholarly saints only made his will stronger. His determination to find a true spiritual master was unflinching, and he continued his journey towards God for many years, learning from the holy saints he met with. During these travels, he closely associated with many elevated Saints of India, read the writings of the great Acharyas of the past and practiced intense devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            After many years, by the grace of Lord Krishna and his Guru, Swami Mukundananda finally found solace at the lotus feet of Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj.

    </span>
	The Bhagavad Gita or the song of God was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive war between two set of cousins the Kauravas and the Pandavas was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons which led to a war of such enormity are given under Introduction, under “The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.”

The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun, though it begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind could not leave his palace in Hastinapur, but was eager to know the on goings of the battlefield.

Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay this miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear what transpired on the battle grounds of Kurukshetra, and give a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra, while still being in his palace.

	<h2>Sānkhya Yog : The Yog of Analytical Knowledge</h2>
    </span>
	<p>In this chapter, Arjun reiterates his utter inability to cope with the situation he finds himself in, and refuses to perform his duty in the impending battle.  He then formally asks Shree Krishna to be his spiritual teacher, and beseeches Him for guidance on the proper path of action in the situation he finds himself in.  The Supreme Lord begins imparting him divine knowledge by teaching him about the immortal nature of the self, which is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.  It merely changes bodies from lifetime to lifetime, just as a person puts on new garments and discards the old ones.  Shree Krishna then moves on to the topic of social responsibilities.  He reminds Arjun of his duty as a warrior, which is to fight for upholding righteousness.  He explains that the performance of one’s social duty is a virtuous act that will open to him the stairway to the celestial abodes, while dereliction of duty will only bring him humiliation and infamy. </p><p style="text-align:justify">Having motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna moves deeper into the science of work.  He asks Arjun to work without attachment to the fruits of his actions.  He terms the science of working without desire for rewards as <em>buddhi-yog</em>, or yog of the intellect.  The intellect must be used to restrain the mental yearning for the rewards of work.  By acting in such consciousness, bondage-creating karmas will be transformed into bondage-breaking karmas, and Arjun will attain the state beyond sorrows. </p><p>Arjun enquires about the symptoms of those who are situated in divine consciousness.  In response, Shree Krishna describes how persons situated in transcendence are free from attachment, fear, and anger; they are equipoised and undisturbed in all situations; their senses are subdued; and their minds are ever absorbed in God.  He also gives a step-by-step explanation of how the afflictions of the mind—lust, anger, greed, etc.—develop, and how they may be eradicated.</p>

	<h2>Karm Yog : The Yog of Action</h2>
    </span>
	   <p>In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains that all beings are compelled to work by their intrinsic modes of nature, and nobody can remain without action for even a moment.  Those who display external renunciation by donning the ochre robes, but internally dwell upon sense objects, are hypocrites.  Superior to them are those who practice karm yog, and continue to engage in action externally, but give up attachment from within.  Shree Krishna then stresses that all living beings have responsibilities to fulfill as integral parts of the system of God’s creation.  When we execute our prescribed duties as an obligation to God, such work becomes yajña (sacrifice).  The performance of yajña is naturally pleasing to the celestial gods, and they bestow us with material prosperity.  Such yajña causes the rains to fall, and rain begets grains which are necessary for sustenance of life.  Those who do not accept their responsibility in this cycle are sinful; they live only for the delight of their senses, and their lives are in vain.</p>

	<p>Shree Krishna then explains that unlike the rest of humankind, the enlightened souls who are situated in the self are not obliged to fulfill bodily responsibilities, for they are executing higher responsibilities at the level of the soul.  However, if they abandon their social duties, it creates discord in the minds of common people, who tend to follow in the footsteps of the great ones.  So, to set a good example for the world to emulate, the wise should continue working, although without any motive for personal reward.  This will prevent the ignorant from prematurely abandoning their prescribed duties.  It was for this purpose that enlightened kings in the past, such as King Janak and others, performed their works.</p>

	<p>Arjun then asks why people commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force.  The Supreme Lord explains that the all-devouring sinful enemy of the world is lust alone.  As a fire is covered by smoke, and a mirror is masked by dust, in the same way desire shrouds one’s knowledge and drags away the intellect.  Shree Krishna then gives the clarion call to Arjun to slay this enemy called desire, which is the embodiment of sin, and bring his senses, mind, and intellect under control.</p>

	<h2>Jñāna Karm Sanyās Yog : The Yog of Knowledge and the Disciplines of Action </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In Chapter four, Shree Krishna strengthens Arjun’s faith in the knowledge he is imparting to him by revealing its pristine origin.  He explains how this is an eternal science that he taught in the beginning to the Sun God, and it was passed on in a continuous tradition to saintly kings.  He is now revealing the same supreme science of Yog to Arjun, who is a dear friend and devotee.  Arjun asks how Shree Krishna, who exists in the present, could have taught this science eons ago to the Sun God.  In response, Shree Krishna discloses the divine mystery of his descension.  He explains that though God is unborn and eternal, yet by his Yogmaya power, he descends on the earth to establish dharma (the path of righteousness).  However, his birth and activities are both divine, and never tainted by material imperfections.  Those who know this secret engage in his devotion with great faith, and on attaining him, do not take birth in this world again.</p>

	<p>The chapter then explains the nature of work, and discusses three principles—action, inaction, and forbidden action.  It discloses how karm yogis are in the state of inaction even while performing the most engaging works, and thus, they are not entangled in karmic reactions.  With this wisdom, the ancient sages performed their works, without being affected by success and failure, happiness and distress, merely as an act of sacrifice for the pleasure of God.  Sacrifice is of various kinds, and many of them are mentioned here.  When sacrifice is properly dedicated, its remnants become like nectar.  By partaking of such nectar, performers are cleansed of impurities.  Hence, sacrifice must always be performed with proper sentiments and knowledge.  With the help of the boat of knowledge, even the biggest sinners can cross over the ocean of material miseries.  Such knowledge must be learnt from a genuine spiritual master who has realized the Truth.  Shree Krishna, as Arjun’s Guru, asks him to pick up the sword of knowledge, and cutting asunder the doubts that have arisen in his heart, stand up and perform his duty.</p>

	<h2>Karm Sanyās Yog : The Yog of Renunciation </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>This chapter compares the path of <em>karm sanyās</em> (renunciation of actions) with the path of <em>karm-yog</em> (work in devotion).  Shree Krishna explains that both lead to the same goal, and we can choose either of them.  However, renunciation of actions cannot be done perfectly until the mind is sufficiently pure, and the purification of the mind is achieved by work in devotion.  Hence, <em>karm-yog</em> is the appropriate option for the majority of humankind. <em>Karm yogis</em> do their worldly duties with purified intellect, abandoning attachment to the fruits of their works, and dedicating them to God.  Thus, they remain unaffected by sin, just as a lotus leaf remains untouched by the water on which it floats.  With the light of knowledge, they realize the body to be like a city of nine gates within which the soul resides.  Thus, they neither consider themselves as the doers nor the enjoyers of their actions.  They are endowed with equality of vision and see a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater equally.  Such truly learned people develop the flawless qualities of God and become seated in the Absolute Truth.  Worldly people strive to relish the pleasures that arise from the sense objects, without realizing that they are verily the source of misery.  But the <em>karm yogis</em> do not delight in them; instead they relish the bliss of God within. </p><p>The chapter then goes on to describe the path of renunciation.  The <em>karm sanyāsīs</em> perform austerities to control their senses, mind, and intellect.  They shut out all thoughts of external enjoyment and become free from desire, fear, and anger.  Then, consummating their austerities with devotion to God, they attain abiding peace.</p>

	<h2>Dhyān Yog : The Yog of Meditation </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In this chapter, Shree Krishna continues the comparative evaluation of karm yog (practicing spirituality while continuing the worldly duties) and karm sanyās (practicing spirituality in the renounced order) from chapter five and recommends the former.  When we perform work in devotion, it purifies the mind and deepens our spiritual realization.  Then when the mind becomes tranquil, meditation becomes the primary means of elevation.  Through meditation, yogis strive to conquer their mind, for while the untrained mind is the worst enemy, the trained mind is the best friend.  Shree Krishna cautions Arjun that one cannot attain success on the spiritual path by engaging in severe austerities, and hence one must be temperate in eating, work, recreation, and sleep.  He then explains the sādhanā for uniting the mind with God.  Just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, likewise the sādhak must hold the mind steady in meditation.  The mind is indeed difficult to restrain, but by practice and detachment, it can be controlled.  So, wherever it wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it upon God.  When the mind gets purified, it becomes established in transcendence.  In that joyous state called samādhi, one experiences boundless divine bliss.</p>

	<p>Arjun then questions Shree Krishna about the fate of the aspirant who begins on the path, but is unable to reach the goal due to an unsteady mind.  Shree Krishna reassures him that one who strives for God-realization is never overcome by evil.  God always keeps account of our spiritual merits accumulated in previous lives and reawakens that wisdom in future births, so that we may continue the journey from where we had left off.  With the accrued merits of many past lives, yogis are able to reach God in their present life itself.  The chapter concludes with a declaration that the yogi (one who strives to unite with God) is superior to the tapasvī (ascetic), the jñānī (person of learning), and the karmī (ritualistic performer).  And amongst all yogis, one who engages in bhakti (loving devotion to God) is the highest of all.</p>

	<h2>Jñāna Vijñāna Yog : Yog through the Realization of Divine Knowledge </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>This chapter begins by describing the material and spiritual dimensions of God’s energies.  Shree Krishna explains that all these have emanated from him, and they rest in him, as beads strung on a thread.  He is the source of the entire creation, and into him it again dissolves.  His material energy, Maya, is very difficult to overcome, but those who surrender to him receive his grace and cross over it easily.  Shree Krishna describes the four kinds of people who do not surrender to him, and the four kinds of people who engage in his devotion.  Amongst his devotees, he considers as most dear, those who worship him in knowledge, with mind and intellect merged in him.  Some, whose intellect has been carried away by material desires, surrender to the celestial gods.  But these celestial gods can only bestow temporary material fruits, and even those, by the powers they have received from the Supreme Lord.  Thus, the most worthy object of devotion is God himself.  Shree Krishna confirms that he is the highest reality and ultimate attainment, possessing eternal divine attributes, such as omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.  However, his personality is hidden by a veil of his divine Yogmaya power, and hence the imperishable nature of his eternal divine form is not known to all.  If we take shelter in him, he bestows upon us knowledge of himself, and on knowing him, we also get knowledge of the self and the field of karmic actions.</p>

	<h2>Akṣhar Brahma Yog : The Yog of the Eternal God </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>This chapter briefly explains several important terms and concepts that are presented more fully in the Upanishads.  It also describes what decides the destination of the soul after death.  If we can remember God at the time of departing from the body, we will certainly attain Him.  Therefore, we must practice to think of Him at all times, alongside with doing our daily works.  We can remember Him by thinking of His Qualities, Attributes, and Virtues.  We must also practice steadfast yogic concentration upon Him by chanting His Names.  When we perfectly absorb our mind in Him through exclusive devotion, we will go beyond this material dimension to the spiritual realm. </p><p>The chapter then talks about the various abodes that exist in the material realm.  It explains how, in the cycle of creation, these abodes and the multitudes of beings on them come into existence, and are then again absorbed back at the time of dissolution.  However, transcendental to this manifest and unmanifest creation is the divine Abode of God.  Those who follow the path of light, ultimately reach the divine abode, and never return to this mortal world, while those who follow the path of darkness keep transmigrating in the endless cycle of birth, disease, old age, and death.</p>

	<h2>Rāja Vidyā Yog : Yog through the King of Sciences </h2>
    </span>
	  <p>In the seventh and eighth chapters, Shree Krishna declared bhakti as the easiest means of attaining Yog, and also the highest form of Yog.  In the ninth chapter, He speaks of His supreme glories, which inspire awe, reverence and, devotion.  He reveals that though He is standing before Arjun in His personal form, He must not be misconstrued to possess a human personality.  He explains how He presides over His material energy and creates myriad life-forms at the beginning of creation, absorbs them back at the time of dissolution, and then manifests them again in the next cycle of creation.  As the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky, likewise all living beings  dwell in Him.  And yet, by His divine <em>Yogmaya</em> power, He remains a neutral observer, ever aloof and detached from all these activities. </p><p>Shree Krishna resolves the apparent confusion of the Hindu pantheon by explaining that the one God is the sole object of worship.  He is the goal, the support, the refuge, and the one true friend of all living beings.  Those inclined toward the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas attain the celestial abodes, and when their pious merits are depleted, they return back to the earth again.  But those who engage in exclusive devotion toward the Supreme Lord go to His Abode.  Shree Krishna thus exalts the super-excellence of unalloyed bhakti that is directed toward Him.  In such devotion, we must live in complete union with God’s will, offering all that we have to Him, and doing everything for Him alone.  By such pure devotion, we will be released from the bondage of karmas and attain the goal of mystic union with God.</p><p>Further, Shree Krishna asserts that He neither favors nor rejects anyone—He is impartial toward all creatures.  If even vile sinners come to His shelter, He willingly accepts them and quickly makes them virtuous and pure.  He makes a promise that His devotees never perish.  Seated within them, He provides what they lack and preserves what they already possess.  Thus, we should always think of Him, worship Him, dedicate our mind and body to Him, and make Him our supreme goal. </p>

	<h2>Vibhūti Yog : Yog through Appreciating the Infinite Opulences of God </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>This chapter is narrated by Lord Krishna to help Arjun meditate on God by reflecting upon his magnificent and resplendent glories.  In chapter nine, Shree Krishna revealed the science of bhakti, or loving devotion, and described some of his opulences.  Here, he expounds further on his infinite glories, with the desire to increase Arjun’s bhakti.  These verses are pleasing to read and enchanting to hear.</p>

	<p>Shree Krishna reveals that he is the source of everything that exists.  The varieties of qualities of humans arise from him.  The seven great Sages, the four great Saints, and the fourteen Manus were born from his mind, and from them all people in the world have descended.  Those who know that everything proceeds from him engage in his devotion with great faith.  Such devotees derive great satisfaction in conversing about his glories and enlightening others about him.  Since their minds are united with him, he dwelling within their hearts gives the divine knowledge by which they can easily attain him.</p>

	<p>Upon hearing him, Arjun declares that he is convinced entirely about Shree Krishna’s paramount position, and proclaims him to be the Supreme Divine Personality.  He requests the Lord to further describe his divine glories that are like nectar to hear.  Shree Krishna reveals that since he is the beginning, middle, and end of all things, everything that exists is a manifestation of his powers.  He is the infinite reservoir of beauty, glory, power, knowledge, and opulence.  Whenever we observe extraordinary splendor anywhere, whatever catches our imagination, sends us in raptures, and infuses us with bliss, we should know it to be but a spark of the opulence of God.  He is the powerhouse from where all beings and things get their magnificence.  For the remaining portion of the chapter, he goes on to describe the objects, personalities, and activities that best display his opulence.  Finally, he concludes by saying that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged by the sum total of what he has described, for he upholds unlimited universes in a fraction of his being.  Thus, we must make God, who is the source of all glory, the object of our worship.</p>

	<h2>Viśhwarūp Darśhan Yog : Yog through Beholding the Cosmic Form of God </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna described his divine vibhūtis (opulences) to nourish and increase Arjun’s devotion.  At the end, he faintly alluded to his universal cosmic form, by saying that all things beautiful, glorious, and powerful manifest from just a spark of his splendor.  In this chapter, Arjun requests to see Shree Krishna’s viśhwarūp, or the infinite cosmic form of God that encompasses all the universes.   Shree Krishna obliges by granting him divine vision.  Arjun then sees the totality of creation in the body of the God of gods.  He observes unlimited faces, eyes, arms, and stomachs in the wonderful and infinite form of the Lord.  The form has no beginning or end, and extends infinitely in every direction.  The splendor of that form is more than a thousand suns blazing forth together in the sky.  The vision makes Arjun’s hair stand on end.  He sees the three worlds trembling in fear of God’s laws.  He witnesses the celestial gods taking shelter of him and the great sages extolling him with profuse hymns and prayers.  He observers all the sons of Dhritarasthra along with their allied kings rushing headlong into the mouth of that fearsome form, as moths rushing with great speed into the fire to perish.  Arjun then confesses that on beholding the universal form his heart is trembling with fear and he has lost his peace of mind.  Terrified, he wishes to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend.  Shree Krishna responds by saying that in the form of time he is the destroyer of the three worlds.  He declares that the great Kaurava warriors have already been killed by him, so being assured of victory, Arjun should get up and fight.</p>

	<p>In response, Arjun praises him as the Lord who possesses infinite valor and power, and offers him repeated salutations.  He asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being.  He implores for grace and requests to see once again the pleasing form of God.  Shree Krishna grants his desire and first returns to his four-armed form, and then to his gentle and loving two-armed form.  He tells Arjun how difficult it is to have a vision of God in the manner that Arjun is seeing him.  His personal form cannot be seen by the study of the Vedas, nor by penance, charity, or fire sacrifices.  By unalloyed devotion alone can one know him as he is, standing before Arjun, and enter into union with him.</p>

	<h2>Bhakti Yog : The Yog of Devotion </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>This small chapter stresses on the super-excellence of the path of loving devotion over all other types of spiritual practices.  It begins with Arjun asking Shree Krishna whom He considers more perfect in Yog—those who are devoted to the personal form of God or those who worship the formless Brahman.  Shree Krishna responds by declaring that both paths lead to God-realization.  However, He regards the devotees of His personal form as the best yogis.  He explains that meditation on the impersonal unmanifest aspect of God is full of tribulations and is exceedingly difficult for embodied beings.  But devotees of the personal form, with their consciousness merged in Him and all their actions dedicated to Him, are swiftly delivered from the cycle of life and death.  Shree Krishna thus asks Arjun to surrender his intellect to Him, and fix his mind in exclusive loving devotion on Him alone. </p><p style="text-align:justify">However, such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul.  So Shree Krishna gives other options, and says that if Arjun cannot immediately reach the stage of complete absorption of the mind in God, he should strive to reach that stage of perfection by constant practice.  Devotion is not a mysterious gift and can be cultivated by regular effort.  If Arjun cannot do even this much, he should still not admit defeat; rather he should work in devotion for the pleasure of Shree Krishna.  If this is also not possible, then he should merely renounce the fruits of his works and be situated in the self.  He then explains that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of knowledge; higher than the cultivation of knowledge is meditation; and higher than meditation is the renunciation of fruits of actions, which immediately leads to great peace.  The remaining verses of the chapter describe the wonderful qualities of God’s loving devotees who are very dear to Him.</p>

	<h2>Kṣhetra Kṣhetrajña Vibhāg Yog : Yog through Distinguishing the Field and the Knower of the Field </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>The Bhagavad Gita consists of eighteen chapters, which are composed of three segments.  The first set of six chapters describes <em>karm-yog</em>.  The second set describes the glories of bhakti, and for the nourishment of bhakti, it also dwells upon the opulences of God.  The third set of six chapters expounds upon <em>tattva jñāna</em> (knowledge scriptural terms and principles).  The present one is the first of the third set of chapters, and it introduces two terms—<em>kṣhetra</em> (the “field”) and <em>kṣhetrajña</em> (the “knower of the field”).  We may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the soul that resides within.  But this is a simplification, for the field is actually much more—it includes the mind, intellect, and ego, and all other components of the material energy that comprise our personality.  In this wider sense, the field of the body encompasses all aspects of our personality, except for the soul who is the “knower the field.” </p><p>As a farmer sows seeds in a field and reaps the harvest from it, we sow the field of our body with good or bad thoughts and actions, and reap the consequent destiny.  The Buddha had explained: “All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on our thoughts; and it is made of our thoughts.”  Therefore, as we think, that is what we become.  The great American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said: “The ancestor of every action is thought.”  Thus, we must learn the art of cultivating the field of our body with appropriate thoughts and actions.  This requires knowledge of the distinction between the field and the knower of the field.  In the present chapter, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of this distinction.  He enumerates the elements of material nature that compose the field of the body.  He describes the modifications that arise in the field, in the form of emotions, sentiments, and feelings.  He also mentions the virtues and qualities that purify the field and illumine it with the light of knowledge.  Such knowledge helps us gain realization of the soul, who is the knower of the field.  The chapter then describes God, who is the supreme knower of the fields of all the living beings.  That Supreme Lord holds contradictory attributes, i.e. He possesses opposite qualities at the same time.  So, He is all-pervading in creation and yet seated in the hearts of all living beings.  He is thus the Supreme Soul of all living beings. </p><p>Having described the soul, the Supreme Soul, and material nature, Shree Krishna then explains which of these is responsible for actions by living beings, and also which is responsible for cause and effect in the world at large.  Those, who can perceive these distinctions and properly pinpoint the causes of action, are the ones who actually see; and they are the ones who are situated in knowledge.  They observe the Supreme Soul present in all living beings, and so they do not degrade themselves by their mind.  They can see the variety of living beings situated in the same material nature.  And when they see the common spiritual substratum pervading all existence, they attain the realization of Brahman.</p>

	<h2>Guṇa Traya Vibhāg Yog : Yog through Understanding the Three Modes of Material Nature </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>The previous chapter explained in detail the distinction between the soul and the material body.  This chapter describes the nature of the material energy, which is the source of the body and its elements, and is thus the origin of both mind and matter.  Shree Krishna explains that material nature is constituted of three modes (guṇas)—goodness, passion, and ignorance.  The body, mind, and intellect that are made from the material energy also possess these three modes, and the mix of the modes in our being determines the color of our personality.  The mode of goodness is characterized by peacefulness, well-being, virtue, and serenity; the mode of passion gives rise to endless desires and insatiable ambitions for worldly enhancement; and the mode of ignorance is the cause for delusion, laziness, intoxication, and sleep.  Until the soul attains illumination, it must learn to deal with these three powerful forces of material nature.  Liberation lies in transcending all three of these modes.</p>

	<p>Shree Krishna reveals a simple solution for breaking out of the bondage of these guṇas.  The Supreme Lord is transcendental to the three modes, and if we attach ourselves to him, then our mind will also rise to the divine platform.  At this point, Arjun enquires about the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas.  Shree Krishna then systematically explains the traits of such liberated souls.  He explains that illumined persons remain ever equipoised; they are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations.  They see everything as a manifestation of God’s energies, which are ultimately in his hands.  Thus, worldly situations neither make them jubilant nor miserable, and without wavering, they remain established in the self.  The chapter ends with Shree Krishna again reminding us of the power of devotion and its ability to make us transcend the three guṇas.</p>

	<h2>Puruṣhottam Yog : The Yog of the Supreme Divine Personality </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna explained that by transcending the three modes of material nature one attains the divine goal.  He also revealed that the best means for going beyond the <em>guṇas</em> is to engage in exclusive devotion.  To engage in such devotion, we must detach the mind from the world and attach it to God alone.  Thus, it is necessary to understand the nature of the world.  In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains this material world in a graphic manner, to help Arjun develop detachment from it.   He compares the material world to an upside down <em>aśhvatth</em> tree (sacred fig).  The embodied soul wanders up and down the branches of the tree, from lifetime to lifetime, without comprehending from where it originated, how long it has existed, and how it keeps growing.  The roots of the tree are above, as it has its source in God.  The fruitive activities described in the Vedas are like its leaves.  The tree is irrigated by the three modes of material nature.  These modes create sense objects that are like the buds on the tree.  The buds sprout aerial roots that engender further growth of the tree.  The chapter describes this symbolism in detail, to convey the idea of how the embodied soul suffering in this material world only keeps perpetuating its bondage here, in ignorance of the nature of this tree of material existence.  Shree Krishna explains that the axe of detachment must be used to cut down the tree.  Then, we must search for the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord Himself.  Finding the source, we must surrender to Him in the manner described in this chapter, and then will attain the divine Abode of God, from where we will not return to the material world again.  </p><p>Shree Krishna then describes how the souls in this world are divine, being His eternal fragmental parts.  But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind.  He explains how the embodied soul, though divine, savors the material objects of the senses.  He also describes how the soul transmigrates to a new body at the time of death, carrying with it the mind and senses from the present life.  The ignorant neither realize the presence of the soul in the body, nor when it departs from it upon death.  But yogis perceive it with the eyes of knowledge and by the purity of their mind.  In the same way, God is also present in His creation, but He needs to be perceived with the eyes of knowledge.  Shree Krishna reveals how we can cognize the existence of God in this world through His glories that shine forth everywhere.  The chapter ends with explanations of the terms: <em>kṣhar, akṣhar,</em> and <em>Puruṣhottam</em>.  <em>Kṣhar</em> are the perishable beings of the material realm.  <em>Akṣhar</em> are the liberated beings in the Abode of God.  <em>Puruṣhottam</em> is the Supreme Divine Personality, who is the unchanging controller and sustainer of the world.  He is transcendental to both the perishable and imperishable beings.  He must be worshipped with all our being. </p>

	<h2>Daivāsura Sampad Vibhāg Yog : Yog through Discerning the Divine and Demoniac Natures </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In this chapter, Shree Krishna describes the two kinds of natures amongst human beings—the saintly and the demoniac.  The saintly nature develops by following the instructions of the scriptures, cultivating the mode of goodness, and purifying the mind through spiritual practices.  It leads to the enhancement of daivī sampatti (godly qualities), eventually culminating in God-realization.  In contrast, there is also the demoniac nature that develops from associating with the modes of passion and ignorance, and embracing materialistic views.  It breeds unwholesome traits in one’s personality, and eventually throws the soul into hellish kinds of existence.</p>

	<p>The chapter begins by describing the saintly virtues of those endowed with a divine nature.  It then goes on to describe the demoniac qualities that must be scrupulously shunned because they drag the soul further into ignorance and the samsara of life and death.  Shree Krishna concludes the chapter by saying that the scriptures should be our authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done.  We must understand these scriptural injunctions and then perform our actions in this world accordingly.</p>

	<h2>Śhraddhā Traya Vibhāg Yog : Yog through Discerning the Three Divisions of Faith </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>In the fourteenth chapter, Shree Krishna had explained the three modes of material nature and the manner in which they hold sway over humans.  In this seventeenth chapter, he goes into greater detail about the influence of the guṇas.  First, he discusses the topic of faith and explains that nobody is devoid of faith, for it is an inseparable aspect of human nature.  But depending upon the nature of their mind, people’s faith takes on a corresponding color—sāttvic, rājasic, or tāmasic.  The nature of their faith determines the quality of their life.  People also prefer food according to their dispositions.  Shree Krishna classifies food into three categories and discusses the impact of each of these upon us.  He then moves on to the topic of sacrifice (yajña) and how, in each of the three modes of nature, sacrifice takes on different forms.  The chapter moves on to the subject of austerity (tapaḥ), and explains austerities of the body, speech, and mind.  Each of these kinds of austerity takes on a different form as influenced by the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance.  The topic of charity (dān) is then discussed, and its three-fold divisions are described.</p>

	<p>Finally, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three guṇas and explains the relevance and import of the words “Om Tat Sat,” which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth.  The syllable “Om” is a symbolic representation of the impersonal aspect of God; the syllable “Tat” is uttered for consecrating activities and ceremonies to the Supreme Lord; the syllable “Sat” means eternal goodness and virtue.  Taken together, they usher the concept of transcendence.  The chapter concludes by emphasizing the futility of acts of sacrifice, austerity, and charity, which are done without regard to the injunctions of the scriptures.</p>

	<h2>Mokṣha Sanyās Yog : Yog through the Perfection of Renunciation and Surrender </h2>
    </span>
	    <p>The final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is the longest and covers many subjects.  Arjun initiates the topic of renunciation with a question about two commonly used Sanskrit words, sanyās (renunciation of actions) and tyāg (renunciation of desires).  Both words come from roots words meaning “to abandon.”  A sanyāsī (monk) is one who does not participate in family life and withdraws from society to practice sādhanā (spiritual discipline).  A tyāgī is one who engages in activities but gives up selfish desire for enjoying the rewards of actions (this is the connotation of the word in the Gita).  Shree Krishna recommends the second kind of renunciation.  He advises that sacrifice, charity, penance, and other acts of duty should never be renounced, for they purify even the wise.  Rather, they should be performed as a matter of duty simply because they ought to be done, without any attachment to the fruits of these actions.</p>

	<p>Then, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of the three factors that motivate action, the three constituents of action, and the five factors that contribute to the result of action.  He describes each of these in terms of the three guṇas.  He establishes that those with deficient understanding see themselves as the only cause of their works.  But the enlightened souls, with purified intellect, neither consider themselves as the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions.  Ever detached from the fruits of what they do, they are not bound in karmic reactions.  The chapter then explains why people differ in their motives and activities.  According to the three modes of material nature, it describes the kinds of knowledge, the types of actions, and the categories of performers.  It then offers the same analysis for the intellect, resolve, and happiness.  The chapter then goes on to paint a picture of those who have attained perfection in spiritual life and are situated in Brahman-realization.  It adds that even such perfect yogis find completion in their realization by engaging in bhakti.  Thus, the secret of the Supreme Divine Personality can only be known through loving devotion.</p>

	<p>Shree Krishna then reminds Arjun that God dwells in the hearts of all living beings, and directs their wanderings according to their karmas.  If we remember him and dedicate all our activities to him, taking shelter of him and making him our supreme goal, then by his grace we will overcome all obstacles and difficulties.  But if, motivated by pride, we act according to our whims, we will not attain success.  Finally, Shree Krishna reveals that the most confidential knowledge is to abandon all varieties of religiosity and simply surrender to God.  However, this knowledge should not be given to those who are not austere or devoted, for they will misinterpret it and mis-utilize it to irresponsibly abandon actions.  But if we explain this confidential knowledge to qualified souls, it is the greatest act of love and is very pleasing to God.</p>

	<p>Arjun then informs Shree Krishna that his illusion is dispelled and he is ready to act as instructed.  In the end, Sanjay, who has been narrating the dialogue to the blind king Dhritarashtra remarks how amazed and astounded he is on hearing the divine conversation.  His hair stands on end in ecstasy, as he recalls the sacred dialogue and remembers the stupendous cosmic form of God.  He concludes with a profound pronouncement that victory will always be on the side of God and his pure devotee, and so will goodness, supremacy, and opulence, for the darkness of falsehood will always be vanquished by the light of the Absolute Truth.</p>
